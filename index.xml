      <description>Hello world, I&amp;rsquo;m Olivier.
I&amp;rsquo;m a freelance product owner &amp;amp; project manager whose experience lies in leading technical teams and providing technical guidance. I’m at my best translating business needs into technological solutions with and for a team.
A great user experience, security and maintainable code are important for me and contribute to both the end-user and developers’ happiness.
I am ambitious and driven with a never-ending curiosity which always keeps me learning.</description>
